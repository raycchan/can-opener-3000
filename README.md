# Catsitter 3000

I love our cat, but sometimes when we're gone for the weekend it's annoying to bribe friends to come over and literally just open a can of wet food for the little brat. Anything on the market either [has been in product development for 2 years](https://pawbot.com/), [have to buy exclusive cans and is invite only](https://www.catzenpup.com/), or require [pre-opened wet food](https://www.amazon.com/TDYNASTY-DESIGN-Automatic-Feeder-Dogs/dp/B01LRMBEN6/) which freaks me out.

Enter Catsitter 3000!

# Iterations:

#### Version 1 - In a box
Drilled a hole in a baseball display box, this only did one pull motion and I forgot that cans need to be popped backwards first.

#### Version 2 - Dual action
Now that I knew I needed 2 motors, I upgraded but the lid didn't even budge because of the angles. Proof of concept wood works though :+1:

#### Version 3 - More wood
Finally landed on this weird shape, the $25 camera I bought off Amazon SHOCKINGLY didn't work well, and the blue gear mostly failed
