# Catsitter 3000

I love our cat, but sometimes when we're gone for the weekend it's annoying to bribe friends to come over and literally just open a can of wet food for the little brat. Anything on the market either [has been in product development for 2 years](https://pawbot.com/), [have to buy exclusive cans and is invite only](https://www.catzenpup.com/), or require [pre-opened wet food](https://www.amazon.com/TDYNASTY-DESIGN-Automatic-Feeder-Dogs/dp/B01LRMBEN6/) which freaks me out.

Enter Catsitter 3000!
